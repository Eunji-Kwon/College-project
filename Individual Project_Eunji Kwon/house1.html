	<p><h2>About This Condo</h2>
	Named after the Davisville Village's founding postmaster, who also helped create its first public school, the J. Davis House Condos has some high standards to live up to. Fortunately, a strong co-development team consisting of the experienced Mattamy Homes and the family-run Biddington Group of Companies ensured the expert execution of this boutique building at 1955-1985 Yonge Street in the Mount Pleasant neighbourhood, at the corner of Belsize Drive.</p>
	<p><h2>The Neighbourhood</h2>
	Named after the Davisville Village's founding postmaster, who also helped create its first public school, the J. Davis House Condos has some high standards to live up to. Fortunately, a strong co-development team consisting of the experienced Mattamy Homes and the family-run Biddington Group of Companies ensured the expert execution of this boutique building at 1955-1985 Yonge Street in the Mount Pleasant neighbourhood, at the corner of Belsize Drive.</p>
	Down the street from the 1955-1985 Yonge, curious neighbours can still explore John Davis’ former post office, at the northeast corner of Yonge and Davisville Avenue — although it’s a Starbucks now. Fortunately, as often is the case, many major brand name stores and restaurants surround this nearby Starbucks.

	Alternatively, there’s an eclectic shopping and eating scene on Mount Pleasant Road, one city block east. For those living in the J. Davis House Condos who don’t prefer Starbucks, most of the cafés, restaurants and boutiques along Mount Pleasant are independently run.</p>
	 	<p><h2>Transportation</h2>
	Those living at 1955-1985 may often pass the aforementioned Starbucks: it’s right across from the closest TTC Station, which is located on the southwest corner of Yonge and Davisville.

	Running along the north-south Yonge-University-Spadina subway line, Davisville Station is just a few stops from downtown Toronto, as well as a connection to the east-west running Bloor-Danforth line.

	Although, those living in the J. Davis House Condos who tend to drive can avoid that Starbucks altogether if they so please. For drivers heading downtown, it’s often easier to head to the next major street west, Oriole Parkway, and head south from there. Oriole becomes Avenue Road, and then eventually University Avenue, an exceptionally wide roadway for the downtown core.

	Finally, for the most direct access to the highway, drivers can head east on Eglinton Avenue, the first major street north of the building. This takes drivers straight to a connection onto the Don Valley Parkway, usually in under fifteen minutes.</p>
